# Phase 2: Homepage Content - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Full homepage experience with hero section, four offerings overview, club CTA, and complete footer. Users should feel the warmth and creativity of Claytopia and understand what's offered.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero section
- Background: finished pottery pieces, blurred for atmospheric effect
- Slogan "Time to get dirty": large, bold, centered — maximum impact
- Height: full viewport (100vh) — immersive first impression
- Scroll indicator: subtle animated arrow at bottom hinting to scroll down
- No CTA button in hero — let the atmosphere speak

### Offerings sections
- Layout: full-width sections, stacked vertically
- Image placement: alternating sides (left/right) between sections
- Content depth: medium description (3-4 sentences covering key points + "Mehr erfahren" link)
- Images: mix of activity photos (hands on clay, workshops) and finished pieces
- Visual style: consistent across all sections — unified, cohesive feel
- Order: Clay Club first (core offering), then Brennservice, Workshops, Gruppen-Events

### Page flow
- Spacing: moderate between sections — balanced, comfortable
- CTAs: multiple throughout the page (subtle) + prominent one before footer
- Mobile: images stack above text content

### Claude's Discretion
- CTA button styling and exact colors
- Section transition effects (if any)
- Exact typography sizes and weights
- Footer content layout (covered in Phase 1 structure)

## Specific Ideas

- Hero should feel immersive — visitor is "entering" the Claytopia world
- Clay Club is the flagship offering — lead with it to establish the community aspect
- Each offering section should make it easy to learn more without overwhelming
