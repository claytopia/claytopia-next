# Roadmap: Claytopia

## Overview

This roadmap delivers the v1.0 Homepage & Foundation milestone for Claytopia. Starting with design foundations (responsive layout, navigation, warm visual identity), we build the homepage content (hero, offerings, CTAs), then add technical polish (SEO, performance optimization, DSGVO compliance). Each phase delivers something verifiable that a visitor can experience.

## Phases
